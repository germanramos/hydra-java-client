#hydra-java-client

Client of Hydra development in java. Hydra is a multi-cloud broker system.Provides a multi-cloud application discovery, management and balancing service. Hydra attempts to ease the routing and balancing burden from servers and delegate it on the client 

For a complete information about the project visit http://innotech.github.io/hydra/.

##Obtain client

###Maven

```
    <dependency>
       <groupId>io.github.innotech.hydra</groupId>
       <artifactId>client</artifactId>
       <version>0.0.1</version>
    </dependency>
```

###From source code 

```
    git clone https://github.com/innotech/hydra-java-client.git
    mvn clean install
```

Take the generated jar in target directory.

##Hydra client basic usage

The basic way to connect to hydra using the java client is:

```
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.config(hydraServerSeed).build();
    LinkedHashSet<String> candidateServers = hydraClient.get(applicationId);
  
    //Some network call using the first of the candidate servers.

```

The config method take only one parameter the hydraServerSeed, this is a LinkedHashSet of String contains the initial urls where hydra client search the hydra server. Once the server is discovered the client automatically refresh the list of the available serves.

In this case the rest of config parameters are configured using the following default values.

###Configuration parameters
Name | Default value | Description 
:---  | :--- | :---
AppsCacheRefreshTime | 60 seconds | The time period that the cache that store the candidate servers for applications is invalidated.
HydraCacheRefreshTime| 20 seconds | The time period that the cache that store the hydra servers is invalidated.
NumberOfRetries| 10 | The client try this number of times to connect to all the register hydra servers.
WaitBetweenAllServersRetry| 300 milliseconds | The time between all hydra servers are tried and the next retry.

To obtain the client after the configuration:

```
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.hydraClient();
    LinkedHashSet<String> candidateServers = hydraClient.get(applicationId);
  
    //Some network call using the first of the candidate servers.
```

###Hydra cache

The Hydra client, in order to reduce the network traffic and improve the overall system performance, cache two resources:

+ Hydra servers, the list of available hydra server.
+ Application servers, the list of current server available for an application id.

You can ignore the available applications server cache when use hydra client:

```
    LinkedHashSet<String> candidateServers = hydraClient.get(applicationId,true);
  
    //Some network call using the first of the candidate servers.
```

This call shortcut the application servers internal cache, requests the candidate servers and refresh the internal cache.

##Advanced configuration

You can cache all the default configuration values using the following methods.

###App cache refresh time

```
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerSeed).
            withAppsCacheRefreshTime(10l).
        build();
```

###Hydra servers cache refresh time

```
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerSeed).
            withHydraCacheRefreshTime(90l).
        build();
```

###Hydra servers number of retries

```
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerSeed).
            withNumberOfRetries(3).
        build();
```

###Wait times between retries

```
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerSeed).
            waitBetweenAllServersRetry(300).
        build();
```

###A complex configuration example

You can change all the parameters when configure the client.

```
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerSeed).
            withAppsTimeOut(10l).
            andHydraTimeOut(90l).
            andNumberOfRetries(3).
            waitBetweenAllServersRetry(300).
        build();
```
