#hydra-java-client

Client of Hydra development in java. Hydra is a multi-cloud broker system.Provides a multi-cloud application discovery, management and balancing service. Hydra attempts to ease the routing and balancing burden from servers and delegate it on the client

##Obtain client

###Maven

```
    <dependency>
       <groupId>io.github.innotech.hydra</groupId>
       <artifactId>client</artifactId>
       <version>26</version>
    </dependency>
```

Hydra client depends on:

```
    <dependency>
    	<groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
    	<artifactId>httpclient</artifactId>
    	<version>4.0</version>
    </dependency>	
```

and

```
    <dependency>
    	<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    	<artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    	<version>2.3.1</version>
    </dependency>
```

###From source code 

```
    git clone https://github.com/innotech/hydra-java-client.git
    mvn clean install
```

Take the generated jar in target directory.

##Hydra client basic usage

The basic way to connect to hydra using the java client is:

```java
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.config(hydraServerUrls).build();
    LinkedHashSet<String> candidateServers = hydraClient.get(applicationId);
  
    //Some network call using the first of the candidate servers.

```

The config method take only one parameter the hydraServerUrls, this is a LinkedHashSet of String contains the initial urls where hydra client search the hydra server. Once the server is discovered the client automatically refresh the list of the available serves.

```java
    LinkedHashSet<String> hydraServerUrls = new LinkedHashSet<String>();
    hydraServerUrls.add("http://localhost:8080");
```

The previous code fragment configure the client to search hydra server in localhost.

In this case the rest of config parameters are configured using the following default values.

###Configuration parameters
Name | Default value | Description 
:---  | :--- | :---
AppsCacheRefreshTime | 60 seconds | The time period that the cache that store the candidate servers for applications is invalidated.
HydraCacheRefreshTime| 20 seconds | The time period that the cache that store the hydra servers is invalidated.
NumberOfRetries| 10 | The client try this number of times to connect to all the register hydra servers.
WaitBetweenAllServersRetry| 300 milliseconds | The time between all hydra servers are tried and the next retry.
BalancingPolicyExecutor|  Delegated | Client-side balancing policy to use. By default none is used. Available Delegated or Nearest

To obtain the client after the configuration:

```java
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.hydraClient();
    LinkedHashSet<String> candidateServers = hydraClient.get(applicationId);
  
    //Some network call using the first of the candidate servers.
```

To check if Hydra service is available:

```java
	HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.hydraClient();
    if (hydraClient.isHydraAvailable()){
    	// Normal Hydra usage
    } else {
    	// Fallback mechanism
    }
```

###Hydra cache

The Hydra client, in order to reduce the network traffic and improve the overall system performance, cache two resources:

+ Hydra servers, the list of available hydra server.
+ Application servers, the list of current server available for an application id.

You can shortcut the available applications server cache when use hydra client:

```java
    LinkedHashSet<String> candidateServers = hydraClient.get(applicationId,true);
  
    //Some network call using the first of the candidate servers.
```

This call shortcut the application servers internal cache, requests the candidate servers and refresh the internal cache.

##Advanced configuration

You can cache all the default configuration values using the following methods.

###App cache refresh time

```java
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerUrls).
            withAppsCacheRefreshTime(10l).
        build();
```

###Hydra servers cache refresh time

```java
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerUrls).
            withHydraCacheRefreshTime(90l).
        build();
```

###Hydra servers number of retries

```java
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerUrls).
            withNumberOfRetries(3).
        build();
```

###Wait times between retries

```java
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerUrls).
            waitBetweenAllServersRetry(300).
        build();
```

###Disable the hydra server refresh timer

```java
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerUrls).
            withoutHydraServerRefresh().
        build();
```


###Disable the app server refresh timer

```java
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerUrls).
            withoutAppsRefresh().
        build();
```


###A complex configuration example

You can change all the parameters when configure the client.

```java
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerUrls).
            withAppsTimeOut(10l).
            andHydraTimeOut(90l).
            andNumberOfRetries(3).
            waitBetweenAllServersRetry(300).
        build();
```

Other example disable all timers

```java
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerUrls).
            withoutAppsRefresh().
            andWithoutHydraServerRefresh().
            andNumberOfRetries(3).
            waitBetweenAllServersRetry(300).
        build();
```

## Experimental: Client Side Balancing Policies

Exists two client-side balancing policies:
* Delegated: Servers are returned in the same order as they are returned from Hydra.
* Nearest: The client sorts the servers by latency executing a ping against each server url returned. If a server does not respond (timeout, blocked icmp) it's assignated high latency. If the host does not exists, it's removed from the list.

This feature is still experimental. The default policiy is Delegated and it's not needed to specify it.

```java
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerUrls).
            withBalancingPolicy(new NearestPolicyExecutor()).
        build();
```

```java
    HydraClient hydraClient = HydraClientFactory.
            config(hydraServerUrls).
            withAppsTimeOut(10l).
            andBalancingPolicy(new NearestPolicyExecutor()).
        build();
```
